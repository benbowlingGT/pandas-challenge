As the Chief Data Scientist for my school district, I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results to assist the school board and the mayor in making strategic decisions regarding the budget and priorities. 

I reviewed a total of 15 schools with a budget of $24,649,428 and a total student body of 39,170. I specifically looked into the math and reading scores and found that out of those 39,170 students, 75% passed math with an average score of 79, 86% passed reading with a score of 82, and 65% of the students passed reading and math.

While looking into the individual schools, I found that the schools that scored the highest:

- Were charter schools.
- Received the least amount of funding.
- Had the lowest student population.

Furthermore, the top five schools outperformed the bottom five schools by 37% and above. Lastly, I found that each school's scores for math and reading were consistent between the grade levels. 

I recommend that the mayor decrease the funding provided to the current schools and use the money to build more schools, as data shows that the schools with the lowest population will perform better. Therefore, it is safe to say that students across the district will receive more attention once this is completed, which will essentially make their math and reading scores increase.
